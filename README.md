I don't know how to make a proper README so here's just a quick description plus personal notes for possible extra features of the game.
- This version of the game PONG can be run at the terminal of your PC. The size is adjustable but it has been defined for an 80x20 field.
- It is set as a two-player game. Player 1 is controlled with buttons 'w' and 's' and player 2 is controlled with 'i' and 'k' for up and down respectively.
- The game starts with the ball at the center of the field and it starts moving after pressing any key.
- By pressing the letter 'q' the game is automatically finished.
- Both paddles are three blocks tall and one block away from their respective lateral wall.
- Below the field there is a scoreboard to track each player's goals.
- After a goal, the ball returns to the center and a key must be pressed to keep playing.

POSSIBLE EXTRA FEATURES FOR THE FUTURE:
1. []Add a starting menu.
2. []Let the player decide the field's size.
3. []Control the ball's speed by setting some pre-defined frame-rates.
4. []Set a high-score that ends the game after any player scores a certain amount of goals.
5. []Set a "pause" button.
6. []Add single-player mode.

WARNING: this game was developed on Windows and it uses certain command terminals exclusive of its OS to refresh the screen after each move of the ball or the paddles.
As such it may not compile on a Linux-based host or macOS.
